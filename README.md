Reproduciblity course project 2020

## Instructions

The analysis and associated code is contained in the `report.Rmd` file. To re-run the code, first clone this 
repository using git:

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/alkc/project-reproducibility.git
```

Open the `project-reproducibility.Rproj` using Rstudio. Next, run the code contained in `install_dependencies.R` script 
to install all analysis dependencies.

You are now ready to-rerun the code contained in the  `report.Rmd` file. The easiest way to do this is to re-knit
`report.rmd` in Rstudio.
