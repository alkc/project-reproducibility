	abstract = {Event labeling is the process of marking events in unlabeled data. Traditionally, this is done by involving one or more human experts through an expensive and time-consuming task. In this article we propose an event labeling system relying on an ensemble of detectors and background knowledge. The target data are the usage log of a real bike sharing system. We first label events in the data and then evaluate the performance of the ensemble and individual detectors on the labeled data set using ROC analysis and static evaluation metrics in the absence and presence of background knowledge. Our results show that when there is no access to human experts, the proposed approach can be an effective alternative for labeling events. In addition to the main proposal, we conduct a comparative study regarding the various predictive models performance, semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches, train data scale, time series filtering methods, online and offline predictive models, and distance functions in measuring time series similarity.},
